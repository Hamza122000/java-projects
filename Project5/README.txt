PROJECT 5

Project members Names: Hamza Benkhalifa & Rishi Selvakumaran

Project members x500s: benkh008  && selva053

Contributions by members:

$$ Ben hamza Khalifa:

- Ben helped to make the hash and hash 4 function, where he completely designed and implemented it. 


$$ Rishi Selvakumaran:

- Rishi helped to make the hash 2 and hash 3 function, where he completely designed and implemented it.


$$ Both members:

- Both members helped to design and implement the add() and display() method and fix the issues that surfaced when they tried to run them. 


- Both members also designed the test cases in the main method to read through the txt files using the algorithm found in the TextScan.java file.


Assumptions:

- We followed the algorithm given in the project manual closely and assumed that the algorithm given works for implementing the hash table. Our program mimics the given algorithm and specifics very closely and it helps to sort the words from the txt files into the hash tables with as much less collisions as possible especially using the 'hash' function.


Features:

- Our program has 4 hash functions with different algorithms built in it to generate random unique keys. They all work with differing rates of collision between the keys when adding the data into the hash table. 

- Our program also meets the project specification listed in the project manual. As of now we don't have any additional outstanding features in our project.


There are no known bugs in the program.
